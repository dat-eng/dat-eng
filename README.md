## 👋 Hi, I'm Sadhana — Principal Platform Automation Architect

I design and build **AI-governed, Zero-Trust automation platforms** that turn infrastructure provisioning into **self-service, policy-enforced workflows** — safe for both **developers and AI agents** to trigger in **GovCloud, enterprise, and SaaS environments**.

🚀 **Core Focus Areas**
- AI-triggerable infrastructure orchestration (Terraform • Vault • Calm • FastAPI)
- Zero-Trust platform design under **FedRAMP / FISMA / HIPAA / SOC2** principles
- Unified provisioning clients & service layers (**CLI + REST API + ChatOps/Agent gateways**)
- **Snowflake / Redshift / Airflow** data platform automation
- **Looker / QuickSight** multi-tenant BI enablement with governance tags
- Policy-as-Code enforcement via **Sentinel + Vault token lifecycle design**

### 🔧 Featured Platform Frameworks (Public Samples)

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **`ai-governed-platform-automation`** | 💡 *Flagship framework* — Zero-Trust Terraform + Vault + Calm provisioning with AI/ChatOps trigger support |
| **`sas_client`** | Python orchestration client wrapping Terraform, Calm, Vault, and Infoblox under one automation surface |
| **`sas_server`** | FastAPI gateway exposing provisioning as **agent-friendly REST APIs** with policy bundle validation |
| **`aws-quicksight-cicd`** | CI/CD-driven provisioning of BI environments for regulated analytics use cases |
| *(More components coming — Terraform policy bundles, Vault patterns, drift remediation modules...)* |

### 🎯 Platform Engineering Philosophy

> **“If a task is repeated twice, it should become a policy-governed platform capability — ideally callable via API, CI, or AI agent. No tickets. No static credentials. No manual escalations.”**

### 🧭 Next (Coming Soon)
- 📌 Drift detection and **agent-driven remediation module**
- 📌 **Explain-Plan API** for LLM-friendly Terraform/Sentinel output
- 📌 Vault pattern guide: **Token lifetimes, scope enforcement, IRM tagging**
- 📌 Secure **Backstage / Developer Hub** catalog components for self-service onboarding
